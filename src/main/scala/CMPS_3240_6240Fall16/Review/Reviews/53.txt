Director Jonathan Demme films every moment of Justin Timberlake's magnetic 2015 Las Vegas concert and creates an experience that's the next best thing to being there. Justin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids is slick, intense, and exciting and fills the screen with Timberlake's exhilarating talent. Everyone on stage is giving it his or her all for the entire 90-minute event. Demme, well known for his beautifully executed concert films, beginning with the iconic Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense, then Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen, and Kenny Chesney, has a way with a camera (in this case, multi-multi-cameras) and an editing team that seems unsurpassable. Pop star/actor Justin Timberlake might seem an unlikely choice for Demme, but the movie proves that the director continues to make inspired choices. Timberlake is worth all the effort and care. Caution for parents: Some lyrics, though not clearly heard, reflect sensuality, sexuality, drinking, and contain some coarse language.
