Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders review

Watching Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders must be what it would feel like taking a trip into the trusty Bat Time Device. One where sidekicks weren't killed, backs weren't broken, Batman and Superman weren't constantly at each others throats and the solution to any problem were just a utility belt pouch away.

There's a joy to Return of the Caped Crusaders that's impossible to deny. It's innocent and appropriately goofy fun crafted by a team that can hardly contain its adoration for the source material. That love is so apparent it might just win over a new generation of fans as well.
Complete disclosure here: Adam West was my first Batman. Whether hearing him voice Batman in Super Friends or watching reruns of the 1966 TV series, West is still the first name that comes to mind when I think of Batman. Ditto for Burt Ward's Robin. So hearing them reprise their roles was enough of a selling point for me.
It's been 50 years since the Batman TV show aired so it's understandable that the original cast doesn't sound as peppy as they did in their heyday. Honestly, even at 75 percent it's a thrill hearing West, Ward and Julie Newmar voice characters they helped make iconic.
