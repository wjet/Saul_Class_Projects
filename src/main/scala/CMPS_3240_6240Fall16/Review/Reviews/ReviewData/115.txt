My Dead Boyfriend desperately tries to look and sound like a quirky indie hit, but that's not an achievable goal when you have an unlikable lead character indifferently rendered by a name star.
Heather Graham is that star, playing Mary, a slacker of a woman who is drifting through life in New York in 1999 when she comes home one day to find her boyfriend, Primo (John Corbett), dead in front of the television, apparently of a heart attack.




To say that this was a casual boyfriend is a bit of an understatement. As Mary notifies his acquaintances, figures out what to do with his dog and tries to dispose of his ashes, she learns both that Primo was a complex, multifaceted fellow and that he wasn't always the most faithful lover. Helping her on this journey of post-mortem discovery are her friend Zoe (Katherine Moennig); Primo's dog walker, Howard (Scott Michael Foster); and a mysterious older man named Joey (Griffin Dunne) who says he knew Mary when she was much younger and now wants only to converse with her over restaurant dinners.
The film, based on the novel Dogrun by Arthur Nersesian, can't decide whether it's an offbeat romance, a self-discovery piece, an exploration of the 1990s punk scene (Mary once played bass in a band and eventually finds herself doing so again) or what. The director, Anthony Edwards, is content to let the actors recite their dialogue without investing anything in it. They seem uninterested in the material, a feeling you're likely to share.
