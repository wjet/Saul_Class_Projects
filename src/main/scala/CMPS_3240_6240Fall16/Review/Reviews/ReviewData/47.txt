What is the moral justification for you to play what is essentially a game of Russian roulette with someone's life? It's a brutal question posed by a journalist against the breathtaking backdrop of Mount Everest. It's also one that nags at you throughout Sherpa, an exceptionally absorbing documentary.
Jennifer Peedom, the director, and her team went to Nepal in 2014 to document the climbing season and observe the Sherpa leader Phurba Tashi, who was to hike to the summit of Mount Everest for a record 22nd time. While they were on the mountain, a gigantic ice block crashed onto one of the routes, killing 16 Sherpas.
Several days later, foreign climbers (who pay upward of $100,000 each) wanted to continue their trek. Many Sherpas demanded that the season be canceled to honor the dead. That dispute lies at the heart of the film.
Sherpas (though that name is synonymous with mountain guides, it denotes their ethnic group) have long been viewed as smiling servants. Yet, in recent years, they've become more educated and aware of the meager rewards they receive for taking immense risks.
A visiting climber navigates the notoriously treacherous Khumbu Icefall twice. A Sherpa, carrying huge amounts of equipment and food for such clients, may walk it 30 times a season, often in the dark. Add to that the arrogance of some wealthy visitors who expect more and more luxuries at base camp, including flat-screen TVs, and resentment is inevitable.
The beautiful views of Nepal, juxtaposed with the occasionally ugly tensions between the groups, make Sherpa complex and sometimes as suspenseful as an action film. Still, despite the disagreements, we're told that everyone agrees on one thing: To do this type of dangerous work, they all must go on pretending that it's safe.
