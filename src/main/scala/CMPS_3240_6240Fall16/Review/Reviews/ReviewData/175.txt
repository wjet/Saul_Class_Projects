Syfy’s Sharknado: The 4th Awakens hit land this Sunday night, and just as with the previous sequel, the forecast called for tireless, tiresome stormchasing (or being chased by storm), as Fin Shepard and family again weathered extremely fishy meteorological phenomena.

Because make no mistake, whereas the original Sharknado was an expectedly silly and serviceable Syfy lark, Sharknado 2: The Second One was downright clever in parts (as confirmed by a partial, second viewing I stumbled into this weekend) and actually had a semblance of a story.
Sharknado 3: Oh, Hell No! was 75 percent NBC Universal cross-promotion, while this latest entry seemed to be solely fueled by the thinking, “How many different -‘nados can we think up? Because adding ‘nado to a noun is innately and hugely hysterical.”

The premise, as it were, revealed that sharknados had been neutralized by scientist Tommy Davidson’s pulse gizmo. But that does no one any good when a sandstorm-based sharknado brews outside Las Vgeas, just as Fin Shepard’s son Matt is eloping. Ian Ziering and Tara Reid reprised their roles as Fin and not-dead April while David Hasselhoff (as Fin’s father Gil) was among the other returning faces. The random and or D-list cameos, as usual, came fast and furious, allowing barely enough time to factor out the effects of aging and ID the actor. And long gone is Parts 1 and 2’s wry delivery of witty-ish dialogue, replaced instead with expected gags — save for an actually engaging scene where Fin and April sorted through the subterfuge and lies they each had been fed during her five-year absence.
