Anyone going to “Spaceman” with the expectation of seeing a version of the major league career of Bill Lee, the pitcher known by that nickname, will be frustrated, maybe even annoyed. The film is interested not in the heart of Lee’s career — he pitched for Boston and Montreal from 1969 to 1982 — but in the end of it, and the slow process of letting go of the glory days.

That makes this a different sort of baseball movie, one in which not much baseball is played. The effort is commendable, but the execution is rocky.
Josh Duhamel portrays Lee, who had some good years in the majors but also had a contempt for authority that left him unloved by management. As we meet him, he is being shown the door by the Montreal Expos. He’s confident he’ll get another job offer, but his reputation in the league has poisoned his prospects, a realization that is a long time in coming.


Many fans admired Lee for his brash fearlessness (he’s now a candidate for governor of Vermont), but the man we meet in this film isn’t particularly likable or charming, just annoying and self-destructive. The movie isn’t helped by occasional voice-overs by the main character, whose chirpiness in them is at odds with the sour fellow we’re seeing onscreen.
The director, Brett Rapkin, has also made a documentary about Lee (“Spaceman: A Baseball Odyssey,” 2006) that focused on his post-major-league career, so he’s obviously fascinated with the guy. But here, intentionally or not, he deflates the Lee legend. This pitcher, like a lot of athletes, may never have been as compelling as the spotlight made him appear.
