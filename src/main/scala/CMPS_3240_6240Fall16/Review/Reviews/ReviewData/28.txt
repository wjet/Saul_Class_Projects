Imperium ( opens tomorrow, 3/5 stars) takes its title from a book written by a far-right thinker, and members of the American right wing - with their hatred of "mud people", the desire to close the borders to non-whites, the resentment at seeing a nation grow more diverse - are the villains in this crime thriller.

Nate (Daniel Radcliffe) is an FBI agent sent by Angela (Toni Collette) to infiltrate hate groups. He poses as a dealer in radioactive materials. He is bait to draw out terrorists.

In this age of the alt-right and the Trumpheads, this movie's timing is impeccable (though the film never mentions current political events).

Radcliffe and Collette make a good crime-fighting team and through their investigations, an interesting cross-section of the white-power movement is shown.

They range from skinheads to sweater-wearing, BBQ-hosting middle-class bigots who look like perfect suburbanites, until their mouths open.

First-time feature director Daniel Ragussis gets too bogged down in the minutiae of plot twists, however, when he should justify the rage of those who feel their nation has been stolen by Jews and coloured people.

By withholding motive, his villains become cardboard baddies.
