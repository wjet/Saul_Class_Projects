Pixar’s sequel to its animated 2003 smash “Finding Nemo” repeats that film’s plot: a challenging under-the-sea trek that ends with the reuniting of a family. This time, it’s the memory-challenged Dory, the scene-stealer from the previous film (voiced, with impeccable timing, by Ellen DeGeneres) who’s out to find her long-lost parents. The action includes a trip through an ocean filled with wisecracking fish, a raucous adventure in a marine facility where life lessons are learned, and, of course, a happy ending. While not as visually dazzling as its predecessor, the film is still colorful and immersive; the script, while predictable, puts an engaging spin on the issues of home and identity. The filmmakers Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane play it safe with the tried-and-true formula to create a lighthearted diversion that should play like comfort food for viewers who are fond of the original. Ed O’Neill, Albert Brooks, Diane Keaton, Idris Elba, and many others provide the eager-to-please voice work.
