Mixed bag ‘Jane Wants a Boyfriend’ explores romance and autism
By Sara Stewart
A young woman (Louisa Krause) with Asperger’s ventures into the dating world despite the skepticism of her actress older sister (Eliza Dushku) in this indie billing itself as “not your neurotypical love story.” But “Jane Wants a Boyfriend” loses momentum careening between Dushku’s Bianca and Krause’s Jane — the latter of whom is far more interesting.
In the film’s best moments, director William Sullivan shows us the world from Jane’s perspective, swirling into sensory overload in the subway or narrowing into focused relief at her costume-shop job at Bianca’s theater. Jane’s blind date with a mentally challenged man may have you cringing as the two go into simultaneous meltdowns, but a budding romance with Bianca’s slacker friend Jack (Gabriel Ebert) is explored with some real empathy for the experience of dating while non-neurotypical.
