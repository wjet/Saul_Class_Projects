THE IVORY GAME Directed by Kief Davidson, Richard Ladkani  Documentary  1h 52m

After learning that a beloved wild elephant has been slaughtered by poachers, Craig Millar, a conservationist, wonders aloud �how we got to this stage, as a human race, when we just lay waste to anything we value � anything we see just gets consumed.� Still, he vows to fight on. �I don�t know if it�s ever going to make a difference, and if we�re ever going to do enough, but we�ve got to try.�

That mixture of sadness and persistence pervades �The Ivory Game,� which follows some of the men and women struggling to end ivory trafficking. There are plenty of heroes here, yet only a little optimism.

�Traders in ivory actually want the extinction of elephants,� Mr. Millar says. The fewer elephants there are, �the more the price rises. The more the price rises, the more people want to kill them.� This circle is illustrated with footage of slain animals in Africa and of ivory carvings in China, where regulated trade is permitted but illegal sales are rampant.

Richard Ladkani and Kief Davidson, the directors, toggle between the two places, and their investigations are perilous � activists in China use hidden cameras to infiltrate the black market; law enforcement officers in Africa stage raids with guns and night-vision equipment. It�s dangerous work, captured with sleek filmmaking. While more information on the animals and their ecosystems is needed, the stakes described here are immense, as is the sorrow over majestic creatures massacred only so that their tusks can be made into baubles.

�The destiny of elephants is entirely in the hands of one single person � the president of China,� Andrea Crosta, an investigator, says. It�s a statement that Xi Jinping, China�s president, needs to hear directly. Someone give him this documentary.
