VERY GOOD DOCS (cont.)
Orange Sunshine
Of course this documentary account of the ’60s California LSD scene opens with “Spirit in the Sky”; it’s the kind of movie that can’t not open with it. The specific focus here is on “The Brotherhood of Eternal Love,” a church dedicated to spreading the word of spiritual revolution — and spreading the tabs that’d lead to it. Their story is a fascinating one, of a group that discovered that the manufacturing, smuggling, and distribution of substances was something they were pretty good at. And it’s told well, by the people who were there, accompanied by period footage, convincingly faked home movies, and stylish reenactments. Fast-paced and energetic, and a brisk and eccentric snapshot of an era.
