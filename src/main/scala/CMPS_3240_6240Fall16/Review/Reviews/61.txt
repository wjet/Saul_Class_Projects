Some of Cai Guo-Qiang�s art exists for mere moments. But my, how long it sticks in the mind. That enchantment is at the center of �Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang,� a documentary that is as rewarding as this artist�s work.
Mr. Cai traffics in many mediums � sculpture, painting, installation. Yet he�s especially known for his work with gunpowder and fireworks. He�s created large-scale shows for the Beijing Olympics and other high-profile events. At his �Ninth Wave� exhibition in Shanghai in 2014, he shot enormous clouds of (environmentally safe) powder into the sky, in effect painting the air. As shown here, it�s wondrous.

�Sky Ladder,� his most personal piece, has been his white whale. The project has been canceled or delayed multiple times over two decades, and the film follows as he again tries to build this burning ladder that will stretch upward some 1,650 feet.
Along the way we learn of Mr. Cai�s adolescence, his inspirations and the commercial and political pressures he encounters. He�s an approachable artist, boyish and friendly rather than pretentious, and Kevin Macdonald, the film�s director (�One Day in September,� �The Last King of Scotland�), trails after him with the same eagerness.
It�s no spoiler to reveal that �Sky Ladder,� the art project, eventually succeeds, and its fleeting existence is magnificent. It says something about the work, and perhaps about life, that brevity adds an element that�s both magical and saddening.
