Surprisingly good, I was expecting something mindless and generic (something like what Ant Man was) but I was surprised to see that it was a lot more thoughtful than the average Marvel film. There's lots about finding meaning, death, and life in general, and there were parts that I found oddly comforting. The only problem I really had with it was that the names and magic seemed a little silly at times. Hearing the name "Dormammu" during a very intense scene is a little ridiculous. But aside from that, not the average origin story.
