Meant to write this after seeing the movie at IMAX with the kids. Fantastic Beasts was a very very good solid movie. The characters were great, casting was almost spot on, the plot didn't disappoint and it just hung together spectacularly. Amazing that you can make an offshoot in a hugely popular world, Harry Potter's world, and really make a beautiful film. If you want to escape the world this is the kind of cinema that'll allow you to do that.
