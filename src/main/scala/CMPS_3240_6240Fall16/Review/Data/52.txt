Once again they couldn't put it away and had to come back with another teenage horror flick trying to vaguely explain the origins of Leatherface. It's so dumb and dull you will not get a single fright from this undercooked, badly written & terribly acted film. It's a shame to the original and also to the fantastic 2003 remake by Marcus Nispel who did back then something very smart, he didn't fuck with the original instead he took it to the next level... this film though does the exact opposite...too bad they could have done something really mad with it...
