Although I did not see the original movie in its entirety, I heard that it was very good for that time period. Showtime's "Westworld had captivated me in a way that I can't really explain because it's a mixture of the future and the past. The story line mixes all the great makings of a well rounded novel with murder, love, espionage, betrayal and the future of science coming to a point of becoming almost human. There are surprises at every turn and I hate to see the credits come up at the end of the show because I'm left with the desire to watch so much more of what happens. ANTICIPATION! It keeps me on the cliff edge of my mind with the closing of every show. This is a show that people who enjoy literature might appreciate.
