Exuberant, busy and sometimes funny, DreamWorks Animation’s “Trolls” is determined to amuse. You remember Trolls — not the rude lurkers online writing nasty remarks, but those little toys with round tummies, beatific expressions and abundant hair shooting upward. Here they’re players in a fairy-tale Cold War parable.
Long ago, a village of Trolls, joyful creatures in a rainbow of colors and patterns, was raided by the Bergens, gray giants with bad teeth who subsist on them. The Trolls escaped and built a new colony far away. Many years later, the Trolls, given to singing, dancing and group hugging, have lowered their guard, and a group of them is captured by the most malevolent Bergen, Chef (voiced by Christine Baranski). The upbeat Troll princess Poppy (Anna Kendrick, evoking “Inside Out” Amy Poehler), with Branch (Justin Timberlake), a glum Troll ever wary of the Bergens, embarks on a rescue mission to the Bergens’ kingdom, where she befriends and gives a beauty makeover to a scullery maid (Zooey Deschanel) smitten with King Gristle Jr. (Christopher Mintz-Plasse).
