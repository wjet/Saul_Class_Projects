Unfortunately, saw this movie on a trip to Seattle, didn't want to have a late night because we were flying back early in the am, this movie was senseless, predictable and not at all believable. The storyline was weak and lacked anything of real interest and a poor development of characters. Naomi Watts carried her part well, but I can't believe any women would put herself in the situations she did especially when she's a Phd in her role??? Netflick's Stranger Things Charlie Heaton was certainly a more interesting part of the cast, but quickly lost my interest when the plot was finally revealed. An awful, awful experience.
