A Texas Chainsaw prequel which is beyond pointless. It is also Ã¼ber violent, so much so that it has a numbing effect. It does feel like they were simply trying to keep up with the torture-porn boom of the time. Ultimately there's no fun to be had here. The first couple of Texas Chainsaw sequels were bizarre and they had a charm. This is a bit of a drag.
