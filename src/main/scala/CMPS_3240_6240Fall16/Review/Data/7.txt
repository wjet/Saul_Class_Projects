Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them takes us back into the wizard ing world with a funny, exciting and thoroughly developed story. Newt Scamander travels to New York with magical creatures to explain their importance but when those beasts get loose, that's when the story begins. The characters are multi-dimensional, with Newt being own odd but likeable character and Kolowski stealing the show as the joke guy who falls for one of the sisters who help Newt on his quest. On the villain side, Farrell makes a convincing villain and Miller is underused. Story wise, the plot moves relentlessly and the plot is unpredictable, which is a good thing. The beasts are cool, the magic is fun, and although it isn't up to par with the Harry Potter films, Fantastic Beasts is a magical beginning to a new series in the wizarding world.
