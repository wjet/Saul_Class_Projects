For my money, Moana is the best Disney animated film of the year. Over five years of great work and research went into the details to represent the Polynesian people and their culture. These days, that kind of effort in films have to be rewarded. There are a few elements that we have already seen in Disney movies in the past but Moana is surely not your typical Disney Princess film. Moana is just a stunning movie to watch and a fun film for the family.
