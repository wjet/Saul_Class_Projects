Bad Santa 2 wants to be it's predecessor, so badly. So badly that it dares to go even deeper down the toilet bowl, and it does so with little jingle bells on it's toes. There isn't a moment in this film where someone isn't insulting someone, or using a colorful variation of the F-word, or engaging in depraved sexual acts in public... and it goes on like this for 90 minutes straight. It makes Adam Sandler's worst cinematic atrocities, like That's My Boy, seem subtle and tame. But the film tries so hard to be repulsive, that it's actually quite remarkable. Seriously, it's almost totally enjoyable to behold it. I was laughing, not because I found any of the jokes particularly funny, but because they were being told in the first place. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
