De Niro gives a really good performance, but it can't figure out if it wants to focus on him as the trainer or the fighter he is training, who is unsympathetic and all over the map when it comes to emotions and actions. Usher isn't convincing as Sugar Ray Leonard and the friendship between him and the main fighter feels forced. It has too many commentaries going on at once and it becomes boring as a result. And it has some insanely out-of-nowhere sex scenes that are forced and thus off-putting. Just a mess overall.
