So I decided to waste an hour and thirty minutes of my life on Netflix's newest film courtesy of their deal with Adam Sandler to put out six "original" movies, the first two being "The Ridiculous Six" and "The Do-Over", which haven't garnered a warm exception from critics but did very well with Netflix's audience, so now here we are with "True Memoirs of an International Assassin", and surprisingly it ain't too bad, it's definitely not good, solid, nor decent but it's a step up from the other two films, probably because Adam Sandler is nowhere to be seen. The direction from Jeff Wadlow is decent, the editing is surprisingly really good, and Kevin James is not a bad actor, but this is nothing more than an average, clich√© action comedy that mostly falls flat on its face, it's a bit of a shame though because the premise is an interesting one that could have been done better with a more focused team behind the scenes.
