Flying bodies. Flamethrowers. Pools of blood.
And that’s just the first few minutes.
“Hacksaw Ridge,” Mel Gibson’s brutally effective World War II drama, highlights the director’s two main themes in his work: religion and violence.
If there was any wonder whether Gibson would soften after spending years outside the limelight due to several explosive bouts with his temper, think again. The battle scenes in “Hacksaw Ridge” are among the most violent captured on film — and also the most urgent.
If the opening scene of “Saving Private Ryan” plunked viewers into the middle of war, “Hacksaw Ridge” does the same, then keeps them there with no hope of being airlifted out.
Ironically, the film tells the story of a peaceful man, a real-life conscientious objector named Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield). Doss was a medic in the Army who refused to pick up a weapon, but never gave up his fight to serve his country and his fellow men. He was credited with rescuing 75 men in battle, and his is a story of bravery and valor.
The scenes leading up to the battle are rather clunky, especially with a miscast Vince Vaughn as Doss’ orders-barking sergeant. Sam Worthington is better as an Army captain, though Garfield’s wide-eyed, aw-shucks portrayal of Doss doesn’t gel early on.
That doesn’t matter once they get to war. Gibson’s eye is fixed on the Battle of Okinawa, and he keeps a steadfast focus on the men, the flying bullets, the burning bodies, the lost limbs and the cold mud that surrounds the soldiers. His portrayal of war is horrific, as it should be.
“Hacksaw Ridge” not only gets its point across, it drives it home with a bullet to the chest.
