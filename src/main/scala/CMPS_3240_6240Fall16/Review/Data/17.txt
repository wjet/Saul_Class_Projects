Great movie. Besides the two latter Captain America movies, the best MCU movie. Uses the typical origin story found in movies like Iron Man but adds enjoyable twists to make it a great movie. The special effects, the occasional humor, along with great actors and scripts makes it a great movie for comic book fans and new audience members alike.
