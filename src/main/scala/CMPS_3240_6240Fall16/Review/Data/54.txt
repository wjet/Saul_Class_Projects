Pacific Rim aims to be just big dumb fun, but instead succumbs to the self-seriousness and dullness that plagues most modern blockbusters such as Michael Bay's Transformers series. Rather than showing us the robots v monsters action we paid to see, the movie makes us spend 90% of the run-time with bland, uninteresting human characters who apart from Idris Elba's character, do little more than attempt to explain the confused plot to the audience. Overall, Pacific Rim wastes a capable cast and director on a sluggish and confused mess that should have been a lot more fun.
