Accordingly, unexplained events and unripened ideas simply accumulate as Clay (John Cusack), a graphic novelist, and Tom (Samuel L. Jackson), a phlegmatic railway worker, trek from Boston’s airport to somewhere in Maine. Having narrowly escaped a murderous mob of flesh eaters — the zombified victims of a mysterious cellphone signal — the pair (mobiles presumably on vibrate) must evade additional infected hordes en route to Clay’s estranged wife and son. That’s the sole hook on which our emotional investment in Clay hangs, and it’s not nearly enough — as Mr. Cusack seems to know, giving possibly the most detached performance of his career.

Even if it weren’t cheap-looking and dreary, “Cell” would still be hobbled by an entertainment landscape already lousy with zombies, and a hive-mind premise that — at least metaphorically — has been all but realized. (Its heedless infected, shuffling forward with eyes cast down, have a chilling real-world familiarity.) Only in the final seconds do we glimpse a possible focus for the narrative, but until then the director, Tod Williams (who in 2004 gave us the affecting Jeff Bridges vehicle “The Door in the Floor”) seems every bit as lost as his characters.
