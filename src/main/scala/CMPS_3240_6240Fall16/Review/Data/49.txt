Prequel to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake is a bland affair that even with the fact that it introduces an interesting back-story; it still fails in terms of quality horror films. The series took a more torture porn esque kind of turn with the original remake and with this entry as well, there is way more gore instead of pulse pounding terror. The prequel, like the remake relies on style versus substance and the result is a disappointing film that leaves horror fans wanting more out of a TCM movie. Acting wise, this film suffers from as poor cast that are pretty forgettable and there's nothing worthwhile here to really enjoy. Younger horror fans may enjoy it, but to those who love a well constructed horror film, they will be disappointed in the result of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning. Remakes and subsequent sequels tend to cheapen a horror fans experience by relying more on computerized special effects than on hand made effects of old school horror features. This might have worked, but unfortunately the film's script leaves a lot to be desired and I found it to be underdeveloped. Although it had an interesting idea, this film ultimately left a lot to be desired. In terms of effective terror, this is one that just doesn't have anything to offer to TCM fans. The film is poorly directed with an interesting, but lacking story, thus it just ends falling apart towards the end. If you've never seen this film or the original remake, you're definitely not missing much. Stick with the original trilogy; at least they were well done, and very entertaining. This film simply tries too hard, and in turn, it fails.
