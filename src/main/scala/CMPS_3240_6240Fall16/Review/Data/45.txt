I'm going to be honest here in defense of my own self righteous, that I went to see this movie cause my friends wanted to see it. I skipped my chance to see Arrival for this movie and I wish I had gone and seen that instead cause this film might just be the hugest disaster of 2016 I've seen this year so far. I'll also add, that all my friends after the movie ended, thought the film was a waste of time, boring, and overall immensely stupid. I guess the only positive I have for this movie is that Charlie Heaton's actually tried to act really well in this film but his character just came off as confusing due to an awful script. Also the cinematography in this film was alright and sometimes beautiful, but cinematography is one of those factors that really don't affect my opinion about a movie, if the overall film is layered with negative factors. Naomi Watts' character in this film was so bland and one dimensional. Her character made so many cliche, stupid, horror movie decisions in this movie and had emotions that were conveyed extremely poorly. The movie takes about an hour to actually get semi-interesting since the first hour is pretty much really bad exposition scenes that don't really have anything to do with the revealing plot at all. This movie also relies on something I hate a lot about certain horror movies: "jump scares." I can't stand them. Literally the only scares in this movies are mainly false scares that aren't even remotely scary. Another negative I just have to mention about this film is the twist ending. Of course I won't spoil it, but, it is a laughably bad twist. What I hate the most about this revealing twist is it has nothing to do with the events that have led up to it, it just came out of nowhere. Readers, if you feel like torturing yourself with a film that is extremely boring for the 1st two acts and has extremely bad script writing, go right ahead and watch this "movie", but if you want to save money and time, just skip this movie for sure. I'm going to give this movie a D- and a score of a 1.5/10.
