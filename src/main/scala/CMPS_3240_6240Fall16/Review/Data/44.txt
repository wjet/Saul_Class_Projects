the writer knows nothing about the winter in new England, horror, or much else.
spoilers to follow.

this movie takes place in a house in Maine in the dead of winter, a place where, although there's a foot of snow on the ground and roof you can break out a skylight with a pan and no snow will come in, just glass. the pond is completely liquid. people who live in new England own no flashlights and discuss going to a hotel because there's a snowstorm.

not to mention ripping off 20 minutes shot for shot from the shining.
