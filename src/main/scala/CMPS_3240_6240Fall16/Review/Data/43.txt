Terrible movie. What a waste of money!I honestly decided to see it because all the other movies that were interesting to me
had already begun. I thought it couldn't be that bad since Naomi Watts was in it
and I think it's a very good actress.
Big mistake!It bored me to death, full of cliches and a story that has been written so many times before.
Avoid at all costs!There's absolutely nothing positive about this movie, a waste of celluloid and talents!
I won't even give it a star, it really sucks!
