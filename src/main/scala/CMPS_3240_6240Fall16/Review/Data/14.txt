Scott Derrickson makes some magic with Doctor Strange. Floating in at a solid 2 hours and change, Doctor Strange pushes through sling rings at a steady pace, never moving to fast or slowing down to a crawl. While the depths of magic and sorcery don't get into nitty-gritty detail, the plot provides enough to put the pieces together. Doctor Strange relies heavily on the visuals and the CG doesn't squander. The opening sequence alone is worth the price of admission. Benedict Cumberbatch's line delivery hits the spot and is the source for some laughs. Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen deliver strong supporting performances along with Rachel McAdams and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Doctor Strange has the humor, the effects, and the entertainment value to complete the package. Now only if the warnings came before the spells.
