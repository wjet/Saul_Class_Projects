Orcs are vast and rapacious hulks; of their many weapons, none are more lethal than their protruding underbites. In short, the last thing you need, if you inhabit the world of men, is an orc passing through a mysterious portal and trashing your peace of mind. Needless to say, that’s just what happens in Duncan Jones’s new movie, which is based on a video game. Azeroth, ruled by a valiant king (Dominic Cooper), is besieged by an army of invading orcs, among them the vicious Gul’dan (Daniel Wu) and the more reasonable Durotan (Toby Kebbell). Other names include Varian, Medivh, and Halforcen; one of the rare charms of this fantastical world is that most of the characters sound like medications, to be taken twice daily after meals. Jones’s film is crowded and scattershot. We hang out with a young magician (Ben Schnetzer), an older magician (Ben Foster), and a resourceful warrior (Travis Fimmel), but neither their gifts nor their destinies detain us for long. Even acts of sacrifice, in the grand finale, feel morally weightless, designed largely to pave the way for a sequel. With Paula Patton, as a half-orc, risking a romantic smooch despite her disconcerting fangs.
