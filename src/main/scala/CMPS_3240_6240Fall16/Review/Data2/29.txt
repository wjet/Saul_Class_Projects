This creepfest initially serves up some good horror-flick fun, but seems to lose the plot as the wind kicks up and the sky changes colour and the chase goes on and on – right down to the exploding-pumpkins climax.

Another point that rankles: Haven’t we had enough of horror-film heroines being punished for doing something “wrong” – in this case having sex, smoking pot, skipping class?
