'The President' review: Tables are turned on a dictator in Iranian filmmaker's return to form: Portland International Film Festival



Mohsen Makhmalbaf was one of the key figures in the Iranian film renaissance of the 1990s, but his films made after 2001's "Kandahar" have rarely been shown in the United States.
After clashing with the Iranian authorities over his movies, he left the country following the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and now lives in Paris. His new film "The President" was shot in the Republic of Georgia, and is a welcome return for a passionate director.
In this satirical allegory, the dictator (Misha Gomiashvilli) of an unnamed country finds himself on the run, accompanied by his young grandson (the adorable Dachi Orvelashvilli), in the wake of a popular revolution. The rest of their family flees the country, but these two end up having to don disguises to blend in among the disgruntled hoi polloi who have suffered under the dictator's rule. Posing as street musicians, they embody the familiar trope of the high and mighty brought low and forced to see what life is like for the other half (or, in this case, the other 99Â percent).
Inspired by uprisings in the former Soviet bloc as well as, more pointedly, the Arab Spring, Makhmalbaf serves up a surprisingly tense, sometimes poignant parable. It's good to have him back.
