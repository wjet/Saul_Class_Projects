“Can you read cursive?,” Willie, a denizen of skid row, asks strangers in Knate Lee’s new film, “Cardboard Boxer.” He needs their help deciphering the singed journal he retrieved from the debris of a fire. Its author, a child, received the diary from her dying mother.
It seems that Willie (Thomas Haden Church) and the girl have a lot in common. He wants her to know she is not alone, not the only one who fears thunder, draws stares and wishes for friends. He writes back, laboriously, with his stub of pencil, then launches his letters as paper airplanes from a Los Angeles rooftop.

Willie blossoms when he enters this child’s broken world, and he does make a friend, Pinky (Boyd Holbrook), a legless veteran who carries his treasured Purple Heart everywhere. Pinky consents to read the cursive script to Willie. They share the raw pain of the child’s descent from grief into hopelessness.
Willie’s own circumstances are enough to make you weep. He thinks nothing of leaning against a trash can as if it were a piece of furniture, or dipping into one to scoop up a half-eaten burger.
But while he may have a gentle soul, at times his innocence makes you wonder how he survives on the street. He steps forward, eager to please when rich kids show up with a video camera. They offer him $50, an arena where he can shine and a hollow promise of friendship. All he has to do is slug it out with another street person — and win.
Mr. Church fully inhabits the character, making the most of Willie’s dented moral sense and his many limitations. But the film constructs some too-perfect solutions to problems and manipulates our emotions. Mr. Lee, straining, ends up delivering a sentimentalism that undermines Mr. Church’s performance and this film’s promise.
