Wishing you had one of those smart houses, where there are cameras everyplace, and the plumbing and lighting and appliances are all computer-controlled? The thriller "I.T." could save you a lot of money. It will make you grateful that you live in an old-fashioned dumb house.
Aside from that, though, there's not much to recommend this formulaic film, which stars Pierce Brosnan as Mike Regan, an executive who apparently missed all the memos about security in the internet age. He's a business hotshot with his own company, but with a big deal looming, he entrusts his corporate files to Ed Porter (James Frecheville), a tech guy who is temping at his company. Mike doesn't even bother to have the fellow checked out.
If that weren't improbable enough, he then asks Ed to pay a house call because his teenage daughter (Stefanie Scott) has been complaining that the internet in his high-tech home is too slow. Needless to say, Ed turns out to be a psycho, and an all-purpose one at that: He is envious of Mike's success, lusts after his daughter and apparently pops pills, too.
Ed uses his unfettered access to bring Mike's company to the brink of ruin and also to gain control of everything in that fancy house, including the cameras, which he uses to voyeuristic ends. Can the overmatched father protect his family and thwart the psychopath? John Moore, the director, and Dan Kay and William Wisher, the screenwriters, don't have anything new to add to that familiar dynamic.
I.T.
