Gleason (now in theaters)
4 stars (out of 4)
You don’t need to know Steve Gleason’s name to be enraptured by his extraordinary story. In 2011, the 33-year-old father-to-be and former NFL star was diagnosed with the degenerative disease known as ALS. Scared but undeterred, he recorded video diaries for his baby son until his voice gave out, then used a machine to learn how to communicate. This documentary uses unfettered family access to chronicle his battle, as he and his equally amazing wife, Michel, forge ahead in their new-normal life. Don’t cry too much for him — Gleason is too busy and optimistic to consider himself a victim.
