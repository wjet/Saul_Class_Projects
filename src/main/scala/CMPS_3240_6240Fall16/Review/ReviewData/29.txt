Imperium� review: Daniel Radcliffe sheds Potter image with scary skinhead role

n and of itself. He�s played a farting corpse, a devil-horned possessee, Frankenstein�s Igor and Allen Ginsberg.

Amid all that, it doesn�t seem all that exotic to be playing an FBI agent who�s working undercover as a skinhead neo-Nazi. But it�s another check on Radcliffe�s stereotype-avoidance strategy.

Imperium is far from the best film on a theme of racist terrorism that�s ever been made. It�s kind of a prosaic, hurried affair with twists that can be seen a mile away.

But it boasts some worthy acting performances. Not least of them from Radcliffe himself, who works through the obvious incongruity of his unimposing size � he�s an ex-Marine no less - by suggesting the defiant steel of someone who was bullied as a child (and is still an object of ridicule to his FBI colleagues).

His innate �woundedness� inspires a superior (Toni Collette) to envision him as a good fit with the racist, anti-Semitic misfits who make up the white power underground � a sudden priority when a shipment of radioactive material is intercepted and the usual radical Islamic suspects don�t pan out.

As agent Nate Foster, racial slurs and profanity trip easily off Radcliffe�s tongue (the better to blend in). If anything, his acceptance by the hierarchy of the racist food-chain seems a little too easy � this despite the fact that the script throws in several sweat-it-out moments where our hero�s cover is nearly blown.

Nate starts at entry-level with the skinheads, low-ranking, violent and drunk. He then gains the confidence of a publicity-hogging national Aryan leader (Chris Sullivan) and an online White Power radio host named Dallas Wolf (Tracy Letts), who is the FBI�s chief suspect as a potential domestic terrorist.

But the real stand-out performance comes from True Blood�s Sam Trammell as Gerry, a calm, likeable family-man who is kind of the social convener for the various white power factions, and who bonds with Nate over their mutual love of classical music.

Gerry is the face of �normal.� His cute kids blithely tell Nate that dad built them a tree-house to hide in �when the mud-people come.� His wife makes cupcakes. He is the one character whose very demeanor doesn�t scream �I am a monster,� and as such, may be the most quietly dangerous of all. It�s a terrifically nuanced characterization.

But subtlety of performance is often lost against the plodding pace and clunky techniques employed by director Daniel Ragussis. Every so often, seemingly randomly, he throws a blinding rapid-fire montage at the viewer of Hitler, Klansmen, burning crosses, violence, etc. We get it. They�re neo-Nazis, bent on setting America ablaze.

In the end, Imperium is fairly gripping entertainment that overcomes its faults. It brings nothing new to the table. But chalk up another unlikely win for Radcliffe.
