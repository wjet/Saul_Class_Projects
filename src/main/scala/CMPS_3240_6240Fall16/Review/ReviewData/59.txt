They hold grudges. They have best friends. They aren’t big on foreplay, and you can revive them with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if they choke during a shampoo.

They are chickens: the ones with perfect combs, pedicured toes and gleaming feathers that compete on the show circuit. “Chicken People,” directed by Nicole Lucas Haimes, looks at dozens of devotees of these fair fowl. The hens and roosters in this documentary are pampered royalty, and their caretakers find fulfillment in the pursuit of perfection.
Shari McCollough of Indiana introduces us to a harem, imitates a mating dance and discusses what she calls the “wham, bam, thank you, ma’am” nature of chicken sex. Brian Knox of New Hampshire has some gorgeous specimens with geometrically patterned plumage. He is meticulous about developing the best traits in his birds, but when his relationship with a fellow hobbyist ended, he decided he was no good at dating. We also meet Brian Caraker, a singer in Branson, Mo., who was forced to choose between his career and his flock, which remains in Illinois with his parents. Still, he frequently consults the poultry bible of breed standards, and lets us in on the protective yet sly nature of roosters and what raising chickens has done for his self-esteem.
Will fluffy, poodlelike chickens replace cats on the internet? Maybe not, but these chicken people, with deep connections to their birds, make for a fun and at times astonishing film. Just don’t raise the prickly question of whether there is a platter in a chicken’s future. As one poultry fancier says when asked if he eats his birds: “Do you got kids? Do you eat them?”
