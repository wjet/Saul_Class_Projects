3 Stars ½
I really enjoyed this film because it deftly covers the intersection of three subcultures: the Asian American experience, the gay experience, and being a gay Asian American (a whole different set of challenges in its own right.) Not so easy to do in an hour and a half rom-com. But what really stood out to me was the caliber of the acting. Both leads were believable and empathetic, regardless of whether or not you agree with their choices.
