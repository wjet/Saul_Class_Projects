The classic adventure tale has been admirably reconfigured to meet modern sensibilities, but the resulting film is simplistic, condescending, and inert. The action is set in the eighteen-eighties, when Belgian colonists, led by Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz), sought to conquer the Congo and enslave its inhabitants. Great Britain’s envoy, John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke, formerly known as Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgård), is informed of the Belgian plot by an American diplomat, George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), and they travel together to thwart it. John’s wife, Jane (Margot Robbie), the daughter of an American teacher in the Congo, joins them and is captured by Rom. Forced to fight once more as Tarzan, the man raised by apes displays his deep roots in Congolese society as well as his ability to talk to animals (who end up engaging in the movie’s most photogenic combat). Meanwhile, the urbane George reminds John, and viewers, of American imperialist and racist depredations of the era. Jane, no mere victim, is an accomplished fighter, but Tarzan inescapably plays the great white savior, and his African counterparts are depicted favorably but emptily. Directed by David Yates.
