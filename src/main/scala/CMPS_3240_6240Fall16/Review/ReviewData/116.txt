My Dead Boyfriend
If you think your life sucks, consider the plight of the protagonist in this horribly titled comedy directed by actor Anthony Edwards. It follows Mary (Heather Graham), an aspiring writer working temp jobs who returns home one day — as the title suggests — to find her slacker boyfriend (John Corbett) deceased in a recliner. Mayhem ensues when she’s tasked with caring for the ashes, which causes her to learn more about him than she ever cared to know. The ridiculous concept manages a few broad laughs, but the characters are consistently more obnoxious than endearing. So is the uneven screenplay, which piles on the forced quirks. (Rated R, 94 minutes).
