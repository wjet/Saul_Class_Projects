Review: Ridiculous ‘I.T.’ derails into pure camp

Don’t call the ‘I.T.’ guy, or anybody that has anything to do with this bad, bad thriller


It’s not always easy to tell the moment a movie completely derails. That’s not the case with “I.T.,” a ridiculous “Fatal Attraction”-style thriller about a techno-stalker and the family he terrorizes.
The key bit comes after Mike Regan (Pierce Brosnan), a wealthy businessman who’s readying a new business model for the super-rich described as “Uber for private planes,” kicks Ed Porter (James Frecheville) out of his home.
Porter helped Regan fix a glitch at work — those darn computers, am I right? — and since has taken to hanging around Regan and his family a little too closely.
So Regan tells him to scram, and Porter drives away brooding. He then cranks up Missing Person’s “Words” and lip syncs along like the co-worker who emotes a little too heavily while singing karaoke to “Total Eclipse of the Heart” at your office holiday party.
From there “I.T.” is off to the races, and Frecheville is in pure camp territory as a jaded hacker coming after Regan’s family for reasons that are never quite clear.
Is it because he felt a genuine kinship with Regan when they worked together? Or does he truly have the hots for Regan’s 17-year-old daughter Kaitlyn (Stefanie Scott)? Or is it because “Fear,” “Swimfan,” “Single White Female,” “The Crush” and “The Hand that Rocks the Cradle” needed an upgrade involving cyber-privacy in a post-Edward Snowden world?
Whatever it is, none of it works outside of its basic cable parameters. It’s a movie about privacy that would be better off kept to itself.
