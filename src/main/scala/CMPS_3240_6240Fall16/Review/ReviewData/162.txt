The fifth installment in the worst animated-feature franchise in movie history continues the formula of its predecessors: celebrity voices (Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Queen Latifah, Adam Devine, Wanda Sykes, Jennifer Lopez, Simon Pegg, Seann William Scott, Jesse Tyler Ferguson), lame gags and frenetic movement, all in the service of a virtually nonexistent story—and the less sense it makes, the better. And once again, inserted at regular intervals are the thrashings of that annoying squirrel and his slippery acorn (inspired by Wile E. Coyote but entirely lacking the comic genius of Chuck Jones). This rendition, like all the ones before, is a harmless but worthless waste of time; reviewing it is as pointless as spending a restaurant column covering the opening of the latest McDonald’s.
