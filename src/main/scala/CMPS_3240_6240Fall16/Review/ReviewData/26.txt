There is law and there is justice, and the two don’t always meet in the straight-edged way the endless horizon and eternal sky do in West Texas.

That’s the raw truth of this gangbusters neo-western by David Mackenzie (Starred Up), scripted by Taylor Sheridan (Sicario). It’s set in a boom-gone-bust locale where the land is as scorched as a man’s dreams and foreclosure and for-sale signs outnumber the flag.

Chris Pine and Ben Foster are brothers Toby and Tanner, who aim to right a wrong by robbing branches of the bank that seeks to opportunistically foreclose on their family abode. Scruffy of face but pure of intention, the bros just want enough to keep the bastards at bay.

Texas Rangers Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and his half-Comanche partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) have other ideas. The FBI considers the robberies small potatoes, not worthy of investigation, but Marcus is on the eve of retirement, and he’s looking for one last notch in his lawman’s belt.

Sheridan channels Cormac McCarthy (and the Coen Bros.) with his idiosyncratic screenplay, as well as Hemingway and Steinbeck. He finds the deep loneliness behind the fading of the “lords of the plains” mythology that both cowboys and Native Americans embrace.

The actors all invest sweat and sizzle into it – especially Bridges, who revels in a role where surface swagger peels back to reveal a man of depth and character. Hell or High Water isn’t just a great time at the movies, it’s one of the year’s best pictures.
