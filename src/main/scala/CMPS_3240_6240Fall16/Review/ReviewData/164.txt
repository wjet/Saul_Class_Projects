Little Fauss and Big Halsy is an uneven, sluggish story of two motorcycle racers - Robert Redford playing a callous heel and Michael J. Pollard as a put-upon sidekick who eventually (in modified finale) surpasses his fallen idol.
Little Fauss and Big Halsy is an uneven, sluggish story of two motorcycle racers – Robert Redford playing a callous heel and Michael J. Pollard as a put-upon sidekick who eventually (in modified finale) surpasses his fallen idol.
Hampered by a thin screenplay, film is padded further by often-pretentious direction by Sidney J. Furie against expansive physical values.
What is very disappointing is the lack of strong dramatic development. Redford’s character is apparent in his very first scene; it never changes. It is in effect the carrier frequency on which Pollard and others must beat, the end result is erratic.
Pollard is very good in lending depth to his character, though his dialect often obscures his dialog.
