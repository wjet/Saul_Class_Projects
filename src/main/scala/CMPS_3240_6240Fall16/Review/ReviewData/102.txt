Kickboxer: Vengeance is almost as silly as the original

Kickboxer: Vengeance



Almost as schlocky as the original, but not nearly as fun, the remake of Kickboxer reimagines the low-budget martial arts cheesefest that cemented Jean-Claude Van Damme as a sort-of-star as a vehicle for Alain Moussi, a high-kicking loaf of white bread with the screen presence one would expect from Jai Courtney�s stunt double. As before, an American kickboxer named Kurt Sloane (Moussi) travels to Thailand to watch his brother fight muay thai champion Tong Po (Dave Bautista, wearing a hairpiece best described as �mop plugs�). In an attempt to simplify the plot of the original, which was already dumber than a bag of rocks, said brother is killed in the ring instead of being paralyzed, leading this police sketch of a hero to seek out Durand (Van Damme, at this point too good of an actor for this material), a fedora-wearing martial arts master who prepares him for the inevitable match against Tong Po through a strict training regimen of underwater bicycling and bar fights.
Directed by puka-shell-necklace B-movie specialist John Stockwell (Blue Crush, Into The Blue) with his usual eye for sweat-glistened hardbodies, Kickboxer: Vengeance attempts a slicker version of the original�s underlying formula of impressive kicks and godawful line readings. There�s always been a place for bad movies in entertainment, and Vengeance has its share of enjoyably crappy moments, be it an unmotivated monologue about The Godfather, a fight atop two motionless and very clearly fake elephants, or something as elemental as a cut to a child actor shrilly yelling, �Coconut time!� It�s not a question of being in on the joke, because there isn�t one; Stockwell and his team are trying to replicate the perceived awesomeness of the first Kickboxer, and little here suggests that they could actually make a better movie than this one. It�s about as authentic as an exercise in intentionally cheesy filmmaking can get nowadays: Moussi is a legitimately and joylessly bad actor; Bautista really is too big and lumbering to play a muay thai fighter; the digital effects are really this bad.
None of it, however, comes within spitting distance of the original�s highs, like its dance sequence, so awkwardly staged and poorly directed that it actually becomes charming. Even though Van Damme�who would develop substantially as an actor once most of his movies started going direct-to-video�was no one�s idea of a thespian in his Kickboxer days, he at least had pretty-boy looks and a sort of goofy Chippendale dancer charisma to lean on. Moussi, a veteran fight coordinator, has a range of motion that often overcomes Stockwell�s indifferent framing of the fight scenes, but he lacks even the acting ability necessary to camp up a scene. A bland beefcake who can throw and take convincing punches, he�s too much of a void to allow Vengeance�s diverting silliness (of which it has plenty) to become infectious.
