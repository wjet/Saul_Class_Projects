Review The comedy 'Joshy' shows how men confront — or avoid — emotional pain

A raucous boys weekend away in Ojai is underlined with tragedy in Jeff Baena’s “Joshy.” Reeling from the shocking death of his fiancee, and with a rental house deposit on the line, Joshy (Thomas Middleditch) and friends Ari (Adam Pally), Adam (Alex Ross Perry) and Eric (Nick Kroll) rally for the sake of what would have been his bachelor party. It’s a weekend of jocular good times and bonding over boys-only bad behavior, with Joshy’s unspoken trauma looming like a dark cloud.
