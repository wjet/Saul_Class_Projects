Alec Baldwin in Francesco Cinquemani’s “Andron.”

If it were at all original, “Andron” would be merely a bad movie poorly executed. That it is instead a knockoff of “The Hunger Games” and “The Maze Runner” makes it all the more condemnable.
The film, written and directed by Francesco Cinquemani, presents a future world in which 10 young adults awaken in an industrial-looking compound with no memory of who they are or how they came to be there. Apparently they’ve also lost any memory of video games or reality TV shows, because otherwise it would be obvious to them that they have been inserted into a survival game.
The problem with characters who know nothing about themselves is that we know nothing about them either, which makes it difficult to care who survives this game. Eventually the characters learn that the whole world is peering in on their survival competition and wagering on it. Sound familiar?
There are two very recognizable faces in this dumb movie: Alec Baldwin, whose character is orchestrating the game, and Danny Glover, “the chancellor,” who oversees the orchestrator. Both phone in their scant roles, and who can blame them? With this uninvolving, incoherently told story, why should they care about bringing their “A” game?
