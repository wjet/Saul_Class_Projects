Review: For ‘Jack Goes Home,’ Cue the Horror Soundtrack
Jack Goes Home Directed by Thomas Dekker Drama, Horror, Thriller R 1h 40m 

 

Thomas Dekker’s chiller “Jack Goes Home” gets off to a fine start. Rory Culkin plays Jack Duncan, a magazine editor looking forward to the birth of his child with his pregnant fiancée (Britt Robertson). But when he learns that a car crash has claimed the life of his father, and that his mother has survived, the neutral, unemotional tones with which he announces the news suggest that something in his past is deeply amiss.
Off he goes to his hometown, where he reunites with his old friend Shanda (Daveigh Chase) and meets a mysterious young neighbor (Louis Hunter). And, of course, he reconnects with his mother (the invaluable Lin Shaye, evincing darker shades than in the “Insidious” series), whose mental state in the wake of the tragedy makes her more likely to erupt in rage than in sorrow.

Unleash the horror conventions: a musty attic containing a videotape revealing a brother Jack had forgotten (or had blacked out of his memory); an audiocassette left by his father imparting cryptic messages; intimations of child abuse; and Shanda’s admission that she had always thought that Jack’s childhood home was haunted. Carving knives and an innocent little dog make appearances as Jack’s sanity unravels.
Mr. Culkin has a quiet, wide-eyed gravity befitting his character, and the cinematography, by Austin F. Schmidt, strikes the proper mood. But the script, by Mr. Dekker, spirals into a muddle of ambiguity, leaving only the imagery and the performances to save the movie. And try as they might, they cannot.
