Nanni Moretti's film follows a director (Margherita Buy) making a movie while her mother is dying, as she tries to balance grief and an egotistical actor (John Turturro).


Critic's rating: 4 stars out of 5
Love, loss and moviemaking — what more could you ask for in a film?

How about John Turturro playing a pompous ass of an actor while speaking Italian?

The terrific "Mia Madre" has all that, and more. If you have ever lost a parent or close relative to a lingering illness, you know about the almost-surreal nature of trying to go about your everyday life while watching someone else’s, someone you care about, slip away. Director and co-writer Nanni Moretti captures the absurd humor and tragedy of the situation perfectly — this is one of those films in which you feel like you’re known the characters for years; Moretti and his actors establish a kind of instant empathy that makes the story all the more affecting.
